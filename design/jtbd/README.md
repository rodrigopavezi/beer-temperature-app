1. When driving the truck,
   I want to see in an easy way all the beers container temperatures and ranges
   so I can be aware and be prepared if any of them are going out of the temperature range.

2. When driving the truck,
   I want to be alerted when a beer container has a temperature out of its range
   so I can take some action to correct it.
